# PDDO-PINN-Helmholtz
Based on the physical information neural network framework (PINNs) to achieve neural network forecasting of sound field information in water.
From various aspects such as computational efficiency and computational accuracy, it effectively improves the inefficiency of 3D sound field computation.
The main technology of the project contains Peripheral Dynamics Operator (PDDO)

How to use:
Dataset: run Dataset.py to get .pickle and .mat
My model:
then run main.py

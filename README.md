## Overview
Based on the physical information neural network framework (PINNs) to achieve neural network forecasting of sound field information in water.
~~undone, hopeing i can finish it...~~
## Usage:

Dataset: run Dataset.py to get .pickle and .mat
```
$ DataSet.py
```

My model:
```
$ main.py
```
## Features:
- [x] Create dataset, include complete pressure.
- [ ] Load dataset, random sample dataset.Create Model. 
- [ ] train and test.

## Current Issues: 
It looks like I got the type input wrong, unit and shape are two kind Arg.

*TypeError: Failed to convert object of type <class 'sciann.functionals.variable.Variable'> to Tensor. Contents: <sciann.functionals.variable.Variable object at* *0x7fd4252b18d0>. Consider casting elements to a supported type.* 
<span class="spoiler">Very stupid mistake,and i'm learning keras to correct it...</span>

## Background:  
I get real-pressure and image-pressure by other method.And choose Family with size [7,7].  
>*Governing equations is Inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation*

If use PINNs:

Left is exact pressure, right is different between PINNs predict and exact solution.Obviously there is a learning error at the near source point where the sound pressure is at a lower sound pressure level. I suspect that the use of PDDO to enhance network performance may solve this propagation problem.

**Thanks to the very powerful framework [SciANN](https://github.com/sciann/sciann) built by Ehsan, I was able to do a little application work on this framework.**

# Sound field information neural network
Sound field information predict with PINNs framwork, in this project-test i try to use ~~peridynamic differential operator...~~
PDDO seems not working,so i retrying split-stepping...

## Overview
~~project undone, hopeing i can finish it...~~  
My project scheduled in "Features".If i finish this project, i'll put features in here.  
I'll put the questions I feel stuck on me in "Current-Issues" and welcome your advice.  
I explain my project simplely in "Background".  

## Usage:

Dataset: run Dataset.py to get .pickle and .mat
```
$ DataSet.py
```

My model:
```
$ main.py
```
## Features:
- [x] Create dataset, include complete pressure.
- [ ] Load dataset, random sample dataset.Create Model. 
- [ ] train and test.

## Current Issues: 
I haven't figured out if this really works, maybe it's no different than increasing the batchsize.

## Background:  
This is because not all points have a large amplitude. Since PINN calculates the loss in a batch, perhaps replacing this batch with the Family calculation will give better results.  
I get real-pressure and image-pressure by other method.And choose Family with size [7,7].  
The point in the 49 black boxes is a batch.
>*Governing equations is Inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation.*  
>Dataset:Figure below is transmission of pressure with range and depth.  
>Ofcourse i split complex pressure in real-part and image-part.So there is two dataset.  
>~~Actually,every application has it's PDEs,i think we should care how to make model work...~~  
>yes...i writed a wrong PDE and i change my phan.

I no longer want to get the exact solution  
>my dataset is also an approximate solution.  
so I train vertically distributed networks and perform a stepwise solution for the one-way propagating sound field.
Here is PINNs results, with *split-stepping method*(or i can't start trainning, LOSS always high):

Figure right is error-pointwise,seems to be working with split-stepping.Part of near-field still not work.
It appears that the lower proximity amplitude results in the network not learning the mechanism, but with low loss.

**Thanks to the very powerful framework [SciANN](https://github.com/sciann/sciann) built by Ehsan, I was able to do a little application work on this framework.**
